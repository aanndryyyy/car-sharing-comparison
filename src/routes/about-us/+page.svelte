      Welcome to our website! Here, you'll find a powerful calculator that helps
      you choose the optimal service provider for your shared car trip which is
      completely free to use. Currently, our services are available exclusively
      in the Estonian market. We provide detailed pricing information for four
      different service providers, two of which Bolt and CityBee also offer
      real-time car location availability.

    <p>Introduction:</p>

    <p>
      Using our application is straightforward and depends on the specific
      information you're looking for. If you're interested in car price
      information, begin by filling out the planner input fields. You have two
      planning options to choose from. The first is a manual planner, where you
      input the duration of your drive and the distance you'll cover during that
      time. Alternatively, you can opt for our automatic planner, which requires
      you to enter the start and end locations of your trip. You can also add
      stopovers to your journey and indicate if it's a round trip, which doubles
      the marked distance.
    </p>

      In the car list, you'll find detailed information about each vehicle,
      including the car model name, service provider name, price per minute,
      price per kilometer, and the total estimated price. If you sort the list
      based on proximity when selecting a car, the car map will display the
      distance between your location and the available cars from a bird's eye
      view. Clicking on the map will enlarge it, providing more detailed
      information about the selected car and a button that will redirect you to
      the corresponding service provider's application.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another essential feature is the live map view, which displays the
      real-time locations of available service providers' cars. The application
      retrieves the most up-to-date location data upon page load, ensuring
      accuracy within a maximum one-minute time frame. If you've been on the
      page for an extended period and want the latest information, simply
      refresh the page.

      devices. Additionally, we've implemented a bookmarking feature, allowing
      you to add the application to your bookmarks for one-click access. Follow
